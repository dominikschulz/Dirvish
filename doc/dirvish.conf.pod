=head1 NAME

dirvish.conf - dirvish configuration file.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The dirvish.conf file provides configuration information and default
values for dirvish.

The file format is fairly simple. Each option requires either a
single-value or a list of values and unless otherwise indicated must be
specified according to its expected type. Single value options are
specified by lines of the form B<option: value>. Options expecting list
must be specified in a multi-line format as shown here where the lines
specifying values are indented by any kind of whitespace even if only
one value is being specified.

 option:
 
      value1
      value2
      .
      .
      .
      valueN

Each value must be provided on its own line. Any leading and trailing
whitespace is discarded. Options whose names with an initial capital
(ex: Foo) are discarded by dirvish itself but may be used by support
utilities. Blank lines are ignored.

While this simplistic format may allow for configuration errors it
allows arbitrary options to be declared that custom support scripts
could use.

A B<#> introduces a comment to the end of the line.

On startup the dirvish utilities will first load a master dirvish.conf
file. B</etc/dirvish.conf> will be tried first but if not present
B</etc/dirvish/master.conf> will be tried.

During installation dirvish may have been configured expect the
system-wide configuration files in some location other than
/etc/dirvish.

Multiple configuration files will be loaded by the B<--vault> and
B<--branch> command-line options as well as the B<config:> and
B<client:> configuration parameters. To prevent looping each
configuration file can only be loaded once.

=head1 DIRVISH OPTIONS

Like the command line each option may be specified any number of times.
Those options that expect lists will accumulate all of their arguments
and single for single value options each specification will override
the ones before.

Boolean values need to specified as B<1> or B<0> or may be specified
using B<SET> or B<UNSET>. Some Boolean values are set by default and
must be explicitly unset if unwanted. Boolean values may also
specified using false, f, no, n or off instead of 0 and true, t, yes,
y or on instead of 1.

Each option is marked here with one of (B) for Boolean, (S) single
value, (L) list or (0) other.

B<SET> I<option option ...> (O)

B<UNSET> I<option option ...> (O)

Set or unset one or more boolean options.

NOTE: The SET and UNSET directives do not use colons E<lt>:E<gt>.

B<RESET> I<option> (O)

Reset a list option so that it contains no values.

This may be used to start specification of the option.

NOTE: The RESET directive does not use a colon E<lt>:E<gt>.

B<bank:> (L)

Specify paths to directories containing vaults.

A I<bank> is a directory containing one or more I<vault>s. The system
supports multiple I<bank>s so that filesystem mount-points can be
managed more effectively.

When a I<vault> is specified the I<bank>s will be searched in list
order until the I<vault> is found. This way I<vault>s can be moved
between I<bank>s or added without having to update a master index.

Multiple B<bank:> values will accumulate.

B<branch:> I<branch_name> (S)

Specify a I<branch> to use.

A I<branch> is a sequence of I<image>s.

This also specifies a default value for B<reference:>.

Setting this in a config file may cause the command line option to be
overridden. Use B<branch-default:> instead.

B<branch-default:> I<branch_name> (S)

Specify a default I<branch> to use.

B<client:> [I<username@>]I<client_name> (S)

specify a client to back up.

Setting this to the same value as hostname will cause dirvish to do a
local copy and stay off the network. This automatically invokes
B<whole-file>.

The first time this parameter is set B</etc/dirvish/>I<client_name> or
B</etc/dirvish/>I<client_name>B<.conf> will be loaded.

B<checksum:> (B)

Force the checksum comparison of file contents even when the inode
fails to indicate a change has occurred.

Default value: B<0>

B<config:> I<filename> (S)

Load configuration file.

Similar to #include, I<filename> or I<filename>B<.conf> will be loaded
immediately.

If I<filename> is a relative path it will be looked for in the vault
and then the system-wide configuration directories.

B<exclude:> (L)

Specify a filename patterns to exclude.

Patterns are based on shell glob with some enhancements.

See B<rsync(1)> for more details.

Multiple B<exclude:> values will accumulate.

B<file-exclude:> I<filename> (S)

Load a set of patterns from a file.

If I<filename> is a relative path it will be looked for in the vault
and then the system-wide configuration directories.

B<expire:> I<expire_date> (S)

Specify a time for the I<image> to expire.

This does not actually expire anything. What it does do is add an
B<Expire:> option to the I<image> summary file with the absolute time
appended so that B<dirvish-expire> can automate old I<image> removal.

Setting this in a config file may cause the command line option to be
overridden. Use B<expire-rule:> and B<expire-default:> instead.

See B<Time::ParseDate(3pm)> for more details.

B<expire-default:> I<expire_date> (S)

Specify a default expiration time.

This value will only be used if expire is not set and expire-rule
doesn't have a match.

B<expire-rule:> (L)

specify rules for expiration.

Rules are specified similar to crontab or in B<Time::Period>formatB<.>

See B<EXPIRE RULES> for more details.

Multiple B<expire-rule:> values will accumulate.

B<image:> I<image_name> (S)

Specify a name for the I<image>.

I<image_name> is passed through B<POSIX::strftime>

Setting this in a config file may cause the command line option to be
overridden. Use B<image-default:> instead.

See B<strftime(3)> for more details.

B<image-default:> I<image_name> (S)

Set the default I<image_name>.

This value will only be used if B<image:> is not set.

B<image-perm:> I<octal_mode> (S)

Set the permissions for the I<image>.

While the I<image> is being created the I<image> directory permissions
will be B<0700>. After completion it will be changed to I<octal_mode>
or B<0755>.

See B<chmod(1) and umask(2)> for more details.

B<image-time:> I<parsedate_expression> (S)

Time to use when creating the I<image> name.

If an absolute time without a date is provided it will be forced into
the past.

If this isn't set the current time will be used.

See B<Time::ParseDate(3pm)> for more details.

B<image-temp:> I<dirname> (S)

Temporary directory name to use for new I<image>. This allows you to
have I<image>s created with the same directory name each run so that
automatic processes can access them.

The next time an image is made on the I<branch> this option will cause
the directory to be renamed to its official name.

B<index:> I<none>|I<text>|I<gzip>|I<bzip2> (S)

Create an index file listing all files in the I<image>.

The index file will be created using B<find -ls> so the list will be in
the same format as B<ls -dils> with paths converted to reflect the
source location.

If index is set to bzip2 or gzip or a path to one the index file will
be compressed accordingly.

This index will be used by B<dirvish-locate> to locate versions of
files. See B<dirvish-locate(8)> for more details.

B<init:> (B)

Create an initial I<image>.

Turning this on will prevent backups from being incremental.

B<ionice:> (S)

Set a ionice value when running rsync. This requires
a Linux kernel version of at least 2.6.13 with the
CFQ scheduler. This prerequesites will be checked on runtime
so its safe to enabled this option. The ionice level is
analogus to nice. A higher value (between 0 and 7) will
lower the IO priority of rsync and should make the system
more responsive during backups.

Default value: B<7>

B<log:> I<text>|I<gzip>|I<bzip2> (S)

Specify format for the image log file.

If B<log> is set to bzip2 or gzip or a path to one the log file will be
compressed accordingly.

Default value: B<0>

B<meta-perm:> I<octal-mode> (S)

Set the permissions for the I<image> meta-data files.

If this value is set the permissions of the meta-data files in the
I<image> will be changed after the I<image> is created. Otherwise the
active umask will prevail.

SECURITY NOTE: The log, index, and error files contain lists of files.
It may be possible that filenames themselves may be or contain
confidential information so uncontrolled access may constitute a
security weakness.

See B<chmod(1) and umask(2)> for more details.

B<nice:> (S)

Set a nice value of n when running rsync. Valid values
are 0 to 19 where 19 is the lowest priority and 0 the
highest. Altough nice supports lower values (higher priorities)
this is not supported.

Default value: B<19>

B<numeric-ids:> (B)

Use numeric uid/gid values instead of looking up user/group names for
setting permissions.

See B<rsync(1)> for more details.

Default value: B<1>

B<password-file:> I<filepath> (S)

Specify file containing password for connection to an B<rsync> daemon
on backup client.

This is not useful for remote shell passwords.

See B<--password-file> in B<rsync(1)> for more details.

B<permissions:> (B)

Preserve file permissions. If this is unset permissions will not be
checked or preserved.

With rsync version 2.5.6 not preserving permissions will break the
linking. Only unset this if you are running a later version of rsync.

See B<rsync(1)> for more details.

Default value: B<1>

B<pre-server:> I<shell_command> (S)

B<pre-client:> I<shell_command> (S)

B<post-client:> I<shell_command> (S)

B<post-server:> I<shell_command> (S)

Execute I<shell_command> on client or server before or after making
backup.

The client commands are run on the client system using the remote shell
command (see the B<rsh>: parameter).

The order of execution is B<pre-server>, B<pre-client>, B<rsync>,
B<post-client>, B<post-server>. The I<shell_command> will be passed
through B<strftime(3)> to allow date strings to be expanded.

Each pre or post I<shell_command>s will be run with these environment
variables B<DIRVISH_SERVER>, B<DIRVISH_CLIENT, DIRVISH_SRC>,
B<DIRVISH_DEST> and B<DIRVISH_IMAGE> set. The current directory will be
B<DIRVISH_SRC> on the client and B<DIRVISH_DEST> on the server. If
there are any exclude patterns defined the B<pre-server> shell command
will also have the exclude file's path in B<DIRVISH_EXCLUDE> so it may
read or modify the exclude list.

STDOUT from each I<shell_command> will be written to the I<image> log
file.

The exit status of each script will be checked. Non-zero values will be
recognized as failure and logged.  Failure of the B<pre-server> command
will halt all further action. Failure of the B<pre-client> command will
prevent the rsync from running and the B<post-server> command, if any,
will be run.

Post I<shell_command>s will also have B<DIRVISH_STATUS> set to
B<success>, B<warning>, B<error>, or B<fatal error>.

This is useful for multiple things. The client I<shell_command>s can be
used to stop and start services so their files can be backed up safely.
You might use B<post-server:> to schedule replication or a tape backup
of the new I<image>. Use your imagination.

B<reference:> I<branch_name>|I<image_name> (S)

Specify an existing I<image> or a I<branch> from which to create the
new I<image>.

If a I<branch_name> is specified, the last existing I<image> from its
history file will be used. A I<branch> will take precedence over an
I<image> of the same name.

If this isn't specified the I<branch> name will be used as a default
value.

B<rsh:> I<command> (S)

Remote shell utility.

This can be used to specify the location of B<ssh> or B<rsh> and/or to
provide addition options for said utility such as B<-p> I<port> for
B<ssh> to use an alternate port number.

If not specified B<ssh> will be used.

This remote shell command will be used not only as the default rsync
transport but also for any B<pre-client> and B<post-client> commands.

B<rsync:> I<command> (S)

Path to rsync executable on the server.

B<rsync-client:> I<command> (S)

Path to rsync executable on the client.

B<rsync-option:> (L)

Specify additional options for the rsync command.

Only one option per list item is supported.

This allows you to use rsync features that are not directly supported
by B<dirvish>. Where B<dirvish> does support an rsync feature it is
probably better to use the the B<dirvish> supplied mechanism for
setting it.

Multiple B<rsync-options:> values will accumulate.

B<sparse:> (B)

Try to handle sparse files efficiently so they take up less space in
the I<vault>.

NOTE: Some filesystem types may have problems seeking over null
regions.

Default value: B<0>

B<speed-limit:> I<Mbps> (S)

Specify a maximum transfer rate.

This allows you to limit the network bandwidth consumed. The value is
specified in approximate Mega-bits per second which correlates to
network transport specifications. An adaptive algorithm is used so the
actual bandwidth usage may exceed I<Mbps> occasionally.

See B<--bwlimit> in B<rsync(1)> for more details.

B<stats:> (B)

Have rsync report transfer statistics.

See B<rsync(1)> for more details.

Default value: B<1>

B<summary:> I<short>|I<long> (S)

Specify summary format.

A short summary will only include final used values. A long summary
will include all configuration values.

With long format you custom options in the configuration files will
appear in the summary.

The default is short.

B<tree:> I<path [alias]> (S)

Specify a directory path on the client to backup.

If I<path> is prefixed with a colon the transfer will be done from an
B<rsync> daemon on the client otherwise the transfer will be done
through a remote shell process.

The optional I<alias> specifies the path that should appear in the
index so B<dirvish-locate> will report paths consistent with common
usage. This can help reduce confusion when dealing with users
unfamiliar with the physical topology of their network provided files.

B<Threads:> (S)

Use threads for concurrent backups. Only evaluated by dirvish-runall.
Set this to 0 to disabled threads. Any number greater than 0 will enabled
threads and is used to limit the number of concurrent threads, i.e. a
setting of 4 will allow four concurrent threads to run. If there are
more vaults to be processed those will wait until one of the running
threads will end. Note: Your perl binary has to be compiled to
support threads.

B<no-run:> (B)

Don't actually do anything.

Process all configuration files, options and tests then produce a
summary/configuration file on standard output and exit.

I can't think why you would do this in a configuration file but if you
want to shoot yourself in the foot, be my guest.

Default value: B<0>

B<vault:> I<vault> (S)

Specify the I<vault> to store the I<image> in.

Although multiple I<vault>s may share a filesystem a given I<vault>
cannot span filesystems. For filesystem purposes the I<vault> is the
level of atomicity.

This will seldom be specified in a configuration file.

B<whole-file:> (B)

Transfer whole files instead of just the parts that have changed.

This may be slightly faster for files that have more changed than left
the same such as compressed or encrypted files. In most cases this will
be slower when transferring over the network but will use less CPU
resources. This will be faster if the transfers are not over the
network or when the network is faster than the destination disk
subsystem.

Default value: B<0>

B<xdev:> (B)

Do not cross mount-points when traversing the tree on the client.

Default value: B<0>

B<zxfer:> (B)

Enable compression on data-transfer.

Default value: B<0>


=head1 SCHEDULING OPTIONS

B<Dirvish:> I<path> (S)

Location of dirvish executable.

If not set defaults to B<dirvish>.

B<Runall:> (L)

Specify I<branch>es to be scheduled for automated backups. Each value
is specified in the form

vault:branch [image_time]

If image_time is set here it will be used.

This option can only be set in the master configuration file and
multiple values will accumulate.

=head1 EXPIRE RULES

Expire rules is a list of rules used to determine an expiration time
for an I<image>.

The last rule that matches will apply so list order is significant.
This allows rules to be set in client, I<vault> and I<branch>
configuration files to override rules set in the master configuration
file without having to use B<RESET>. In most cases it is better to use
a B<expire-default:> value than to define a rule that matches all
possible times.

Each rule has an pattern expression against which the current time is
compared followed by a date specifier in B<Time::ParseDate> format. See
B<Time::ParseDate(3pm)> for more details.

A matching rule with an empty/missing date specifier or specifying
B<never> will result in no expiration.

The time pattern expression may be in either B<crontab> or in
B<Time::Period> format. See B<crontab(5) and Time::Period(3pm)> for
more details.

The crontab formated patterns are converted to B<Time::Period> format
so the limitations and extensions for the specification of option
values of B<Time::Period> apply to the B<crontab> format as well. Most
notable is that the days of the week are numbered B<1>-B<7> for
B<sun>-B<sat> so B<0> is not a valid wday but B<sat> is.

Here are two equivalent examples of an expire-rules list.

      expire-default: +5 weeks
      expire-rules:
 
      #MIN  HR    DOM   MON         DOW   EXPIRE
      *     *     *     *           1     +3 months
      *     *     1-7   *           su    +1 year
      *     *     1-7   1,4,7,10    1     never
      *     10-20 *     *           *     +10 days
 or:
 
      wd { sun }                          +3 months
      wd { sun } md { 1-7 }               +1 year
      wd { 1 } md { 1-7 } mo { 1,4,7,10 } never
      hr { 10-20 }                        +10 days

This describes is an aggressive retention schedule. If the nightly
backup is made dated the 1st Sunday of each quarter it is is kept
forever, the 1st Sunday of any other month is kept for 1 year, all
other Sunday's are kept for 3 months, the remaining nightlies are kept
for 5 weeks. In addition, if the backup is made between 10AM and 8PM it
will expire after 10 days. This would be appropriate for someone with a
huge backup server who is so paranoid he makes two backups per day. The
other possibility for the hour spec would be for ad-hoc special backups
to have a default that differs from the normal dailies.

It should be noted that all expiration rules will do is to cause
dirvish to put an B<Expire:> option in the summary file. The
B<dirvish-expire> utility will have to be run to actually delete any
expired I<image>s.

Dirvish was created by J.W. Schultz of Pegasystems Technologies.

Dirvish is now maintained by Keith Lofstrom at www.dirvish.org , with
the able assistance of many others.

=head1 BUGS

Rsync version 2.5.6 has a bug so that unsetting the B<perms> option
will not disable testing for permissions. Disabling perms will break
image linking.

Options set in configuration files will override command line options
that have been set before the file is read. This behavior while
consistent may confuse users. For this reason the more frequently used
command line options have options paired with a I<default> option so
the order of specification will be more forgiving. It is recommended
that where such default options exist in configuration files they
should be preferred over the primary option.

It is possible to specify almost any command line option as a option.
Some of them just don't make sense to use here.
