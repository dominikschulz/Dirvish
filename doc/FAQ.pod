=head1 Dirvish FAQ

=head1 General Questions

=head2 Is "Dirvish" an acronym?

No.

If you want to pretend it stands for B<Dir>ectory B<Vi>rtual B<S>torage
B<H>ost or anything else you can invent go right ahead. I won't issue a
fatwah.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 Why the name?

Because what makes this backup system distinct is that it writes to
spinning media. That reminded me of the whirling dervishes.

At first I rejected this for several reasons but I finally decided that
it was just too anti-PC and anti-(I<so-called>)-multi-cultural to
resist.

Think it of a fast rotating backup system and take it for a spin.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 What is different about dirvish?

Dirvish uses cheap disk space to maintain the appearance of multiple
copies of source file trees. Traditional backup systems write to tape.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 What about disk mirrors?

Disk mirroring (RAID-1) and RAID-5 (not really mirroring) are good at
protecting you from certain kinds of disk failure. Unfortunately they
can't protect the data from human error, OS and hardware induced
filesystem corruption, or anything that destroys the computer. For that
you need a copy of the data that is isolated from the cause of failure.

Ideally the backup server should be in a different building.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 What about backups on tape?

Look at the price of tape drives, robots and blank media. If you are
already doing backups to tape, When was the last time a tape or tape
drive failed? Compare that with the price and longevity of disk space,
case and controllers.

By putting your dirvish server in a separate location from your
production servers it becomes an off-site backup.

That said, you may still want to make tapes. With dirvish you can
relegate tapes to off-site storage and long-term archive so you will
make far fewer of them. And you can make the tapes from your backup
server during working hours with no down-time.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 What about network load?

If you have used network backup systems you may have seen the backups
saturate your network. I know I have. Dirvish shouldn't do that.

Dirvish uses rsync for network transfer. Where an incremental tape
backup requires only requires transmitting the changed files, dirvish
only requires transmitting the changed parts of the changed files. So
while the result is full backups every time, the volume of data sent is
even less than incremental tape backups.

In fact the volume of data transferred can be sufficiently low that
backups over the internet are feasible.

In some cases the network will actually be faster than the disk
subsystems. When that is the case the B<whole-file> parameter will
actually improve overall performance at the expense of network load.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 Why so many images, don't I only need one?

In an ideal world you wouldn't need any backups. I don't always know
that I need a given file restored on the day it gets trashed. Often it
will take several days before I even notice it. Most users are much
worse. Someone deletes or modifies a file or deletes a whole directory
and it turns out a few weeks later that someone else still needed it.
One or two versions just don't cut it.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 What does dirvish cost and how is it licensed?

Dirvish is free. The license is OSL.

I would like to know if dirvish is helping so if you are using it
please let me know. Also let me know about any bugs you find or
improvements you might come up with. I would be particularly interested
in getting statistics on real-world capacity requirements.

=head1 Capacity Questions

=head2 How much space do I need for dirvish?

A reasonable rotation program should need about one and half to three
times the space of the original filesystem. This is very dependent on
the rate of change for a given directory tree and the number and
age-range of images in the rotation.

Consideration should be given to the nature and probable change rates
of a given backup area and the value of older data. Project areas and
home directories may have relatively low rates of change but are
subject to sudden spikes and their data is important enough to retain
for extended periods. Conversely /var has a high change rate but the
data is really only valuable for one or two days. So a vault for /home
might want thrice the space of the production area to hold images
ranging from one to three months or longer while /var may only need
fifty percent more space in its vault and be expired after 2 or three
days.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 How should I build the filesystems for dirvish?

Dirvish can back up almost any filesystem. Only the vaults on the
backup server have any specific requirements.

Only regular files will be shared between images. Device nodes,
symlinks, directories and other file types will be recreated for each
image. This means that there will be a lot more inodes used in a vault
than the source filesystem.

The best filesystem type for dirvish would be one that doesn't set a
fixed number of inodes at build time. The vaults will also need to be
built with a filesystem type that supports hard links.

While a journaling filesystem is a recommended the journals can have an
adverse affect on performance. Dirvish and dirvish-expire do a lot of
filesystem meta-data changes. This will stress the journal which in
some cases is not as well optimized as one would like. Experience has
shown that some journaling filesystems perform extremely poorly under
dirvish. While no benchmarks have been made the difference in speed has
been as high as 10:1. I would not recommend data journaling.

Using a filesystem type that allows resizing makes it much easier to
adapt to the real world requirements of each backup set.

If you are building filesystems with a fixed number of inodes such as
UFS or ext2 you should create the filesystem with a bytes per inode
value that is half or even just a quarter of what you would normally.
Because directories will not be shared it may be good to use a smaller
block or fragment size to reduce internal fragmentation.

I would also recommend using RAID-5 arrays for the vaults. You are
going to have a great deal of important data here and disk-fault
tolerance is a good idea. RAID-5 isn't nearly as expensive as mirroring
and should be more than fast enough. Logical Volume management is also
a good idea for the vaults as you will probably wish to resize some of
them over time.

On Linux, using XFS for the bank has proven to be very fast, especially
for dirvish-expire.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 With so many images, won't it use too much disk?

Because dirvish shares unchanged files between images the actual disk
space used is considerably less than you might think. For most
filesystems only a small percentage of files will change over a period
of time.

The B<dirvish-expire> utility will automatically delete old images
based on their assigned expiration date. If you execute this regularly
(see cron) each vault will soon reach a steady state where it grows
very slowly in response to the growth of the clients.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 Could linking between images be limited by a maximum link count?

Yes. But you are unlikely to ever come close to the limits.

    Linux Filesystem	link limits
    -------------------------------
    xenix		126
    sysv		126
    minix		250
    coherent		10,000
    ufs			32,000
    ext2		32,000
    reiserfs		64,535
    minix2		65,530
    jfs  		65,535
    xfs  		65,535 or 2,147,483,647

I can remember a version of UFS that had a link count limit of 1023 but
I doubt current versions are so limited. I haven't checked the
commercial UNIXes but an examination of the 2.4 Linux kernel source
shows that link counts are stored in an unsigned short so in theory
would be limited to 65535. The 2.6 kernel is expected to raise this
limit and use unsigned long (32 bit). Each filesystem type has its own
limit as shown in the table. Performing a quick test I determined that
indeed I could create exactly 32000 hard links of a file on ext2.

What this means is that on most of the filesystems even if you had a
file with 100 hard links (busybox perhaps) you could still support over
300 images sharing those links.

In the event you are using a filesystem type that has a risk of hitting
the limit you could change hard links on the client to symlinks. None
of these filesystems have limits lower than 126.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 How can I save space?

First make sure you aren't backing up useless files. The exclude
patterns can help there.

Look at the dirvish logs. They will show you what is changing. When I
first started using dirvish I found web browser caches were a constant
source of change. There was no reason to back them up so I added
exclude patterns to block them. Spool areas are similar sources of
waste.

Set reasonable B<expire-rule>s in the configuration files.

Some applications provide choices regarding file layout. A particularly
good example is email. Because a changed file is not shared large mbox
mail folders that change daily can be responsible for a considerable
amount of backup space. Transitioning to maildir format means more
small files but those files can be shared across images as long as they
remain in the same status and folder. Such applications often have
global configuration files in which system administrator can set a
desired default that most users will not override. Similarly there can
be an advantage to rotating log files more often.

Examine the logs. Some services will create log files in places you
don't expect. Adding them to the exclude list is a workaround. Moving
them to /var will correct the problem and make your system more robust.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 Why would dirvish suddenly need more space?

Because dirvish saves space by sharing unchanged files across multiple
images changing many files will cause dirvish's disk usage to spike.

Some of the things that can cause this are:

=over

=item * updating a software package.

=item * restoring a directory tree without preserving timestamps and
permissions.

=item * recursive chown, chgrp or chmod.

=item * sometimes users will update lots of files all at once.

=item * relocating or renaming a directory.

=item * leaving a temporary file around overnight.

=back

It really is a good idea to have enough free space to weather a usage
spike.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 I'm running out of space what do I do?

Delete images.

Usually it is the same files that change over and over. Because of this
deleting intermediate images may save nearly as much space as deleting
old images.

Really old images can be archived to removable media and then deleted.

Sometimes the pressure is transient. A spike may be the result of one
image having captured a temporary file such as a web download. In such
a case the spike will go away with that one image. If someone recently
changed a large number of files that will cause a spike in the disk
usage. Such a spike will form a new plateau until the older images are
expired.

If your rotation just won't fit examine your exclude lists, expiration
rules and consider adding backup space.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 What about compression?

Compression is a wonderful thing but one of dirvish's primary goals is
transparency. If dirvish compressed files you couldn't do a transparent
restore.

Because of the file sharing between images compressing individual
images into compressed archives is unlikely to save you space and will
break the transparency. Experience has shown that the disk usage of
dirvish is vastly less than that of compressed snapshots.

It may be worthwhile to use a filesystem that supports transparent
compression such as e2compr for some vaults.

It is worth remembering that more and more applications are storing
their data in compressed formats such as jpg, ogg, mpeg and gzip'ed XML
(office suites). If the files are already compressed it won't save
space storing them on a compressed filesystem or compressing them
externally. These compressed format files will also defeat the hardware
compression found on tape drives.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 What will dirvish do if it runs out of space?

Dirvish will output a message to STDERR that it thinks it may have run
out of space and will remove the incomplete destination tree. The
meta-data including log files will be left to assist with debugging.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 What should I do if dirvish runs out of space?

First, delete any failed image. If dirvish actually runs out of space
and cannot complete a backup image that image should be deleted. It
will be missing files and have other problems that would cause
successive images to not share correctly.

You may wish to delete some of your images or enlarge your vault
filesystem. That is of course your call.

See the section on running out of space.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head1 Questions about use

=head2 How much maintenance does dirvish require?

Very little.

Dirvish, dirvish-runall and dirvish-expire will report errors when
detected. Running them under cron, even in quiet mode will still cause
email notification on error.

Dirvish-expire will use the expire options to manage the rotation of
images automatically. That mainly just leaves monitoring the disk space
to ensure that you don't run out of room and making archives.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 How do I restore from dirvish?

Each image is a complete copy of what existed at the time it was made
so all that is needed to restore from an image is to copy the files. It
is essential to preserve ownership, permissions and modification time
of restored files.

Rsync is a very good way but scp or streaming tar or cpio archives from
the backup server will work as well.

It is also possible to do a read-only export of a dirvish vault using a
network file system such as NFS or CIFS/SMB. This or network mounting
the source directories on the backup server will allow the use of a
simple copy command to restore files. It should be remembered that NFS
over UDP does have a measurable error rate so exercise caution doing
large restores over NFS. The permissions of all the files in a vault
are the same as the source location so there is little security risk to
doing so. It might however be better not to give users access to this
as it will encourage lazy habits.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 How can I find what versions of my files exist?

That is the purpose of the dirvish-locate command.

You first need to identify the file you are looking for. Examine the
source tree or one of the dirvish indexes (you instructed dirvish to
create indexes, right?). Optimally you want a perl regex pattern that
will only find the file you want.

Let us suppose i'm looking for a version of my .muttrc file. I would
use the pattern B</jw/.muttrc> The slashes have no special meaning and
the pattern is anchored the at the end so this won't match a
.muttrc.orig file. The dirvish-locate command would look like this:

 # dirvish-locate home '/jw/.muttrc'
 2 matches in 29 images
 /e/home/jw/.muttrc
     Apr  9 18:38 030427, 030426, 030425, 030424, 030423, 030422, 030421
                  030420, 030419, 030418, 030417, 030416, 030415, 030414
                  030413
     Mar 26 22:24 030406
     Mar 26 22:24 030403, 030330
     Mar 15 06:09 030323, 030316
     Mar  9 17:26 030309
     Jan 14 21:46 030223, 030216, 030209, 030202
     Oct  5 18:20 030105, 021103
     Oct  5 18:20 021006
     Aug 17 20:15 020901

From this we can see a partial history of that file. Now i don't have
to look in every image to find the version i want. I can either pick a
version or look at one image per version to decide which one i really
want to restore.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 How can I make archives from dirvish?

You can use any utility that will make an archive from a directory.
Feel free to use tar, cpio or dump. It is even reasonable to burn CDs
or DVDs if your data will fit. The nice thing is that this won't
interact with the production systems so you can do this during working
hours.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 Does dirvish support database backups?

Dirvish supports arbitrary pre and post processing commands on the
client and server. This means that you can pause a database during
backups or have dirvish create a database dump just prior to backing up
the dump directory.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 What do I need to run dirvish?


 Unix or Linux server
 rsync version 2.6.3 or higher (earlier versions are insecure).
 Perl 5 and these perl modules
      File::Find                     # comes with perl 5.8.6 and later
      POSIX                          # comes with perl 5.8.6 and later
      Getopt::Long
      Time::ParseDate
      Time::Period

The extra modules can be installed with CPAN:  

 root# perl -MCPAN -e shell

 cpan> install Getopt::Long  Time::ParseDate  Time::Period

 (much verbiage omitted)
 ...
    /usr/bin/make install  -- OK
 cpan> q

 root#

If the modules are already installed, the CPAN process will let you
know that the modules are all up to date.


------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 Can I use an rsync daemon?

Dirvish can connect to an rsync daemon running on the clients just fine.
Specifying the B<tree> parameter with a colon prefix will direct 
dirvish to connect to an rsync daemon on the client.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 What is a bank, a vault, a branch, and an image?

A B<bank> is a directory that contains vaults (and B<only>) vaults.
Don't put anything else in there (especially a file named I<summary>)
or dirvish might get confused.  You can specify multiple banks in your
B<master.conf> configuration file or other configuration files.  You
can put other files and directories on the same disk, but not in
the same bank directory with the vaults.

A B<vault> is where a collection of B<images> are stored, along with
configuration information, stored in the directory $VAULT/dirvish/  .

An B<image> is the result of a dirvish backup operation, and (except
for excluded files) appears to be a complete duplicate of the client
directory structure at a particular time.  If you make nightly backups,
there will be one image per night.

A B<branch> is a way to save images from many clients that are very
similar.  If you have three clients I<tom, dick>, and <jane> that have
very similar /usr directories, you can backup them all into one vault
by using branches.  Every night, you will add 3 images to the shared
vault: I<tom-YYYY-MMDD-HHMM, dick-YYYY-MMDD-HHMM,> and
I<jane-YYYY-MMDD-HHMM> .  

The wiki ( http://www.dirvish.org/wiki?VaultBranch ) contains more
information on banks, vaults, branches, and images.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 What's with the configuration file formatting?

The parser for the configuration files is pretty simple minded. 
The parser is unaware of dirvish keywords, it just saves information
in a Perl hash for later processing.  The parser determines the
difference between a single-valued item ( a boolean or scalar )
or a multiple-valued item ( a list ) by the line breaks and white
space in the configuration file.  All indented lines are treated
as elements in a list, thus defining the first unindented line
above that line as the name of a list (which is stored as a Perl
array).  So if you have some configuration lines reading:

 bank:  bank1 bank2 bank3        #wrong, should be different lines
 index:                          #wrong
        gzip                     #wrong, should be same line
 exclude:                        #wrong
 /proc/                          #wrong, should be indented
 /tmp/foo/                       #wrong

... the above lines will be interpreted as a scalar item named "bank"
with a single value of "bank1 bank2 bank3", an array named "index"
with one entry containing the value "gzip", and scalars with a value
of zero named "exclude", "/proc/", and "/tmp/foo/"  .  Dirvish will
get confused when it tries to process this, since it is expecting
an array for bank and exclude, and a single scalar value for index.

Instead, you should write your configuration lines to read:

 bank:                           #right
        bank1                    #right
        bank2                    #right
        bank3                    #right
 index: gzip                     #right
 exclude:                        #right
        /proc/                   #right
        /tmp/foo/                #right

These will be properly interpreted as a 3 element array, a scalar,
and a two element array.

Remember, indents and line breaks mean specific things to dirvish.
The configuration format is not free-form, you must follow the rules
if dirvish is to interpret it correctly.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head2 Pre and Post configuration scripts

These scripts are run before and after the actual dirvish run itself.
They permit you to mount disks, start a server, open a port, or whatever
else you might need to do prepare for or clean up after running dirvish
for a single vault.

The scripts run in the following order, for each vault:

 pre-server
 pre-client
 dirvish --vault=$VAULT
 post-client
 post-server

Dirvish-runall makes multiple calls to dirvish, once per vault, and
the scripts will be run once per vault.  You can place the
B<pre-server:, pre-client:, post-server:, and post-client:> lines
in B<master.conf>, and run the same scripts on every vault, or you
may add these lines to a B<$VAULT/dirvish/default.conf> configuration
file to call scripts tailored specifically to that vault.  Note that
the B<pre-client> and B<post-client> scripts must reside on and be
executable on the I<client>, not the dirvish I<server>.

You may not need to run any scripts at all, in which case the 
configuration files should not have options for them.

------------------------------------------------------ back to L</Dirvish FAQ>.

=head1 Environments

=head2 Linux-Vserver

Please note that dirvish won't run properly on Linux-Vserver guests,
because it can't create some special files correctly. If you plan to
run dirvish inside a Vserver guest you should make sure that special
files (/proc, /dev, etc.) are excluded.
