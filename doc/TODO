dirvish

todo:
! debian: require schedutils, libcurses-ui-perl, libwww-perl
! http://wiki.dirvish.org/index.cgi?RestoreWholeDisk
! create nice Makefile w/ uninstall target
! remove/rename incomplete backups
! graph data usage (?) - see rsnapgraph
! add munin plugin (contrib) to show length of runs, disk-usage, etc.
! add threads to dirvish-expire? -> no, since IO is the bottleneck anyway
? check fslint/findup -m to reduce storage requirements
? add alternate concurrency using fork
? concurrency: differntiate between local and remote queues (only on local backup at once, but multiple remote)
? debian packaging included
- incorporate changes from debian packages
- write to logfile when SIGnaled to be killed
- see File::Spec::Functions, File::Basename for portablity
- add email reporing
- add logging to syslog, see Sys::Syslog (p. 937)
* use system-independent path separators using File::Spec catfile
- clean code (move subs to bottom, add comments, ...) - see rsnapshot

- http://wiki.dirvish.org/index.cgi?LongerSummary
- http://wiki.dirvish.org/index.cgi?RestoreSomeFiles
- http://wiki.dirvish.org/index.cgi?ChmodOnExpire
- resume backups
- do not run if a certain condition is met (e.g. ioquake is running!)

ideas:
* web-based frontend for dirivsh (CGI)
- nice web-page, including security contact, FAQ, screenshots, man page, etc.

done:
* dbus notifications (kde & gnome) when the backup starts end ends, see test4.pl -> wall in dirvish-conjob
* rename DirvishHack.pm to Dirvish.pm, refactor all common code to Dirvish.pm
* use strict
* use warnings
* moved imsort and imsort_locate back to where they came from, since it made no
  sense in this case to have them in a common class
* removed dependency on File::Find
* http://wiki.dirvish.org/index.cgi?RemoveCoreExclude
* http://wiki.dirvish.org/index.cgi?TextBooleans
* http://wiki.dirvish.org/index.cgi?RestrictExpireWalk
* use three-fold open ($handle, ">", $file)
* Add notice: Dirivsh won't run in a vServer (rsync cant create special files)
* prevent backing up the backup directory
* new Makefile/build-script
* made rsync-like patterns (*.xml) work by prepending a dot to the pattern
* fixed bug in dirvish-expire: $basecmd was prepended w/o space to rm
* add locking for dirvish-expire
! add cronjob (cron.d)
* add configration examples in examples
* dirvish-setup.pl: run dirvish --init after configuration
* add link to current backup
* move dirvish-locate to bin (incl. man page)
* add global and per-backup "bwlimit" and pass it along to rsync (already there ;))
* add locking for dirvish-runall (var/run/dirvish.pid) and dirvish (inside vault - /bank/vault/dirvish.pid)
* SIG Handler
* setup script
* concurrency for dirvish-runall using threads
