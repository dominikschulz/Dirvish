Daily Email Summary of Backups

I have this script run every morning at 9:00 to email me the status of
the dirvish backups run the previous night. It contains a
one-line summary of all machines that had errors, followed by du -h
output, followed by a more detailed summary of each machine.
An example email follows the script below.

Note: this assumes you use an image-default: %Y%m%d and the backups
are dated with the previous night's timestamp (using run-alls time
feature). If your setup is different, you may need to adjust accordingly.

    # Also, try to guess the last night a backup occurred.

    if [ "z$last" = "z" ]
    then

    echo "             (last backup: $last)"
    WARNINGS="$WARNINGS $machine"
  else

    # Otherwise, we assume that if there is no Status: success, 
    # the backup wasn't successful. It could be that the backup is
    # still running, but is still worth a look.
    if [ `grep -c "Status: success" $YESTERDAY/summary` -eq "0" ]
    then
      echo "** WARNING: Backup not successful"
      echo

    # Copy the backup's summary file to the email, ignoring
    # any exclude: lines (to keep the email short, but useful.)
    (grep -v "^ "|grep -v "^exclude:"|grep -v "^$") < $YESTERDAY/summary
  fi
  echo

====================
Example Email Report
====================

Note the [] on the subject line. This means that there were errors/warnings.
The script looks for possible vaults that you've created but not added to
run-all, so it alerts you that the machine is missing. When you have a lot
of machines, it's easy to overlook that one wasn't completely setup to be
backed up.
