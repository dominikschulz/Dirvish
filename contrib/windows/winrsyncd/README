Backing up a Windows machine using rsyncd
=========================================

First, you need to install http://winrsync.sunsite.dk/ on your windows
machine.

If you already have Cygwin installed, it also includes an rsync binary;
adjust the command lines in the files below appropriately; winrsync
includes only the cygwin .dll and rsync binaries.)

On the client machine, copy the sample rsyncd.conf, rsyncd.secrets,
and rsyncd.bat files below to c:\program files\winrsync\.

Finally, make Windows run the rsyncd.bat file on startup.

============
Client Files
============

These files need to be present on the Windows machine. I put them all
in the same directory as the Winrsync binaries, but you could of
course put them elsewhere.


c:\program files\winrsync\rsyncd.conf
-----------------------------------------------------------------
gid = users
read only = true
use chroot = false
transfer logging = false
log file = rsyncd.log
log format = %h %o %f %l %b
hosts allow = 192.168.0.253
hosts deny = 0.0.0.0/0
strict modes = false

[backups]
path = /cygdrive/c/
auth users = backups
secrets file = rsyncd.secrets
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: You need to change 192.168.0.253 to be the address of your
dirvish server. You could also use a hostname, or use a subnet
(192.168.0.0/24, for example.) This line restricts what machines
can access the share.

You can also change path= to just be a specific directory 
e.g., c:\documents\ would be path=/cygdrive/c/documents/)



c:\program files\winrsync\rsyncd.bat
--------------------------------------------------------------------
@ECHO OFF
cd c:\PROGRA~1\winrsync
c:\PROGRA~1\winrsync\support\rsync --daemon --config rsyncd.conf
------------------------------------------------------------------
The rsyncd.bat script needs to be run on Windows startup to start
the rsync daemon as a background process.


c:\program files\winrsync\rsyncd.secrets
--------------------------------------------------------------------
backups:mypassword
------------------------------------------------------------------
Change mypassword to a better password, of course. :)


============
Server Files
============
These files are for the dirvish server.

Your default.conf file for the windows machine will look like:

default.conf
------------------------------------------------------------------
client: backups@<winmachine>
password-file: /etc/dirvish/win.password
tree: :backups
   ... rest of file ...
------------------------------------------------------------------
(with any additional site-wide preferences you have.)

Note the leading colon on the tree: line. :backups means use the
backups share on the Windows rsyncd server. We define backups in
our client-side rsyncd.conf file to point to the c:\ directory.

Note: If you have multiple windows machines and don't want to
have the same password on each, you may need a separate
/etc/dirvish/win.password file. In that case, you may want to
store the password file in the same directory as your default.conf
file. Adjust the config above as needed.

/etc/dirvish/win.password
-----------------------------------------------------------------
mypassword
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This should match the password in rsyncd.secrets. make sure the
copy on your dirvish machine has permissions of 600.
